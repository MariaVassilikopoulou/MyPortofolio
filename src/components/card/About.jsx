    const about = `I am Maria Vassilikopoulou, a passionate and enthusiastic frontend developer. Iâ€™m currently sharpening my skills in React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frontend frameworks. At the same time, I am gaining knowledge in .NET Cloud Development, focusing on Microsoft Azure cloud, Azure DevOps, and database management.

I have a strong foundation in software development and a keen desire for continuous learning. My education has equipped me with a wide range of skills, including proficiency in C#, SQL, React, TypeScript, and tools such as Git and Docker. I also have experience in agile methodologies, UX/UI design, and cloud architecture, making me adaptable to dynamic and collaborative environments. I am also self-learning Python and Java.

I have successfully developed dynamic web applications, managed databases, and created interactive interfaces. Some of my notable projects include an e-wallet system, a personal portfolio website, and a library management system.

Fluent in Swedish and English, with Greek as my mother tongue, I bring a multicultural perspective to my work. Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy programming, exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, working out, traveling, and spending time with friends.

I'm eager to grow my skills in the tech industry and look forward to the opportunities ahead. `;
